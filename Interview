Q1: So you're finishing up your time in this CSCC program. Why did you decide to embark on this journey?

-The reason for me embarking on this journey is what an amazing opportunity it would be for my family and I. I need a career and I have always been interested in technology so I thought it would be a good fit.

Q2: I love to travel. Tell me a bit about your favorite travel destination so far. What's on your travel bucket list?

-A buddy and I went to drove to Colorado a few years back and I fell in love with the mountains. We stayed in Boulder but visited Golden, Denver, and a handful of other cities there. I really want to visit Japan.

Q3: Name your favorite member of The Beatles, and your favorite Beatles song. You do know at least one Beatles song, right? If you are a Beatles fan, feel free to give me your top 5 or so.

-I do like the Beatles but don't have a favorite member as much as a favorite album, "The White Album" is without a doubt my favorite. Sgt. Pepper being a close second.

Q4: Do you have any pets? Species/Name/Details please. Murray wants to know... (he's not as smart as that picture makes him seem).

-I have a dog named Luna or I guess I should say my daughter does. I like animals but never really wanted the extra responsibility but my daughter has been begging for years and we finally gave in. a little chorkie lol
